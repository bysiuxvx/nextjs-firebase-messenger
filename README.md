# **Next.js messenger** `under construction üõ†`

## Description

Messenger app using [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) as the database platform, the chat component is provided by [Chat Engine](https://chatengine.io/).

The whole application was built using [chakra](https://chakra-ui.com/) as it's component and UI library. The app comes with dark / light mode üòé.

`This app is still far from complete. Currently working on theming some of the components so they look better with dark / light mode. Still have not made up my mind about the default 'light' theme. Also planning to add other authentication methods, as well as the possibility to register directly in the app.`

## Thoughts

I just have to say - I really fell in love with chakra-ui ‚ù§Ô∏è.
Working with this library is pure pleasure, the syntax is very simple and intuitive. Also it comes with already built in color modes, which can be used for dark / light mode like in this case. It needs to be tweaked accordingly to our needs of course.
